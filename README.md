## Beliefs

`denatural` has no current ending in scope.

The language development started as a way of learning about languages. The base implementation was developed following the exquisite [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) from Bob Nystrom.

In top level jargon, `denatural` intends to be a loosely-towards-strongly typed [1], middle-level [2], inter-compiled [3] language.

[1] types are inferred, but can be specified for better compilation;

[2] memory can be automatically cleared/collected, or freed by the programmer;

[3] the language can both be interpreted and compiled.

On another level, `denatural` is a space for desearching the ideas surrounding `Field-Oriented Programming`, having `fields` as the main tool of the language, where `fields` exert control over `cells`.
