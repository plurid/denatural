<<< space start sign
>>> space end sign

usage:

<<< space-name
    // a new space and scope is created here
>>>


imports:

<<< space-1
    import foo from space-2

    foo()
>>>


<<< space-2
    export compute foo():
        log('works from space-2')
>>>


an IDE/tool will be used to generate the spaces
without having to write them in the file manually
